# Cleaning-and-Exploring-Big-Data-using-PySpark

The project involves the cleaning, exploration, and visualization of big data using PySpark. An open source dataset containing information on all the water wells in Tanzania was utilized. The data type of columns was changed, categories with low frequency in character columns were renamed, and missing values in numerical columns were imputed. The data was also visualized by converting the Spark dataframe to a Pandas dataframe.
