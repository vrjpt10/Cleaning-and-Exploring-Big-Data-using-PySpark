# Cleaning-and-Exploring-Big-Data-using-PySpark

In this project, cleaning, exploring and big data visualization is done using using PySpark. We used an open source dataset containing information on all the water wells in Tanzania. We changed columnâ€™s data type, renamed categories with low frequency in character columns and imputed missing values in numerical columns. We also visualized data by converting Spark dataframe to Pandas dataframe.
